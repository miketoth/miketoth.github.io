### Thoughts from [this HN post](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=18715416)

One of the things Ferrucio says in his reflection is that there are no rules. I think that is an important senitment to have especially when giving advice. Advice is guidence, direction, and focus. Focus is a tradeoff -- as we pay more attention to one thing we naturally pay less attention to others. However, as an aspiring writer my biggest challenge is not exploration, ideas, or creativity but focus, consistency, and determination. Its too easy to take a break, start a new project, or allow distractions to grab my attention. And is this sentence, this blog, this goal a distraction itself? There is no great wisdom here or even a better re-statement of well-worn ideas. Its just a meandering of a mind that hasn't found where to lay its head.

Sometimes I dread doing the easiest things - sometimes they bring me joy. The hardest thing to learn is to take risks -- to have (as they say at amazon) a "bias for action". Its almost always easier to wait and react. And is it not better to wait? The bible says "Good things come to those who wait". And so much pain and suffering has come from making a rash decision. But my writing here (and posting) is rash. It can't wait or I will drown it. After years of telling myself I was polishing, preparing a perfect entrance, I know that I was afraid to start and to fail. Afraid I would not live up to my own expectations. And yet even as I write this I know I am writing in a rut. I've written this or something similar before. I've tried to move sideways, tried to climb out, tried classes, and promises, and incentives but at the end of the day I am back where I started.

There is an Iron and Wine song about failing after "all of my up hill crawling". Its a beautiful song and a beautiful description of sisyphus.

I don't have any blogging advice and I'm not qualified to give any. I just enjoyed the post, want to congratulate the author on 10 years of blogging at 21, and say I appreciate the focus and the reminder that there are no rules. Its your blog. Do whatever the fuck you want.
