### Thoughts from [this HN post]

Its important to note as jonnyblarney did: the median amount is $100.00. FB is valuable as a network but only a few people highly value it. The rest price it higher than I expected but not an order of magnitude higher. Among other things, I think the study's methodolgy leaves something to be desired. 

If it was run across multiple years it would give a better picture. The dollar amount is incredibly volitle -- users could desert FB overnight enmasse. It does raise an interesting question how to measure the value created by FB and other internet sites from an economic perspective. The time I spend on FB contributes slightly to the GDP by way of PV ad revenue but only per reload -- FB does not refresh ads mid-session afaict (think TV commercial beaks). Its actually unclear what is and isn't monetized on FB/other platforms. For example, if I make myself more targetable does that increase US GDP? Personally, I would prefer an economic measurement that reflected the individual gain rather than corporate gain. Obviously, I am not in the position to run my own surveys across the country but maybe I can patch one together from available data. Like a consumer happiness index. The point is there are other goals our market (distributed decision-making game) can accomplish than capital accumulation. Why not happiness? Why not elimination of poverty? If a market isn't the right structure, then what is?
